## Description
As a manager at an internet retail company I would like a back end for my e-commerce website. This back end uses the latest technologies in keeping data updated so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies. When I run tests on API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to quickly and successfully make necessary modifications to data in my database.

## Installation

There are several steps involved. The most important are to make sure you establish reliable and smooth flowing access to your mySQL account as well as the abiltiy to quickly and easily open a local port on your PC in order to use Insomnia effectively.

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
2. Install the following NPM modules on your root directory:
     * dotenv: 8.6.0
     * express: 4.18.2
     * mysql2: 2.3.3
     * sequelize: 6.32.0
3. Clone this repo to your machine.
4. Open .env and enter your database name and mySQL login crendentials.
5. Open a terminal on the project folder
    * Login: mysql -p (your password)
        * Type in 'SHOW DATABASES;' to see any databases in your account
        * Type in 'DROP DATABASE databasename_db;' to delete a database
        * Type in 'CREATE DATABASE databasename_db;' to create a database
        * Type in 'SHOW DATABASES;' to verify the database was successfully created
        * Quit mysql with 'quit;'
6 Open a terminal on the seeds folder
    * Type in ’npm run seed’ to seed the database
7. Open a terminal on the server.js file and type in ’npm start’ to start the server
8. You will now be ready to use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) to test API routes you have created.
